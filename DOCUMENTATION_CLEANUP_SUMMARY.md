# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Action:** Consolidated and archived NEOD documentation

---

## What Was Done

### ✅ Created New Documentation

1. **`NEOD_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`** - Comprehensive status document
   - Full system overview
   - Current issues and what's been tried
   - Technical details and configuration
   - Recommended solutions
   - Testing procedures
   - Historical context

2. **`NEOD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick reference card
   - Current blocker at a glance
   - Recommended fix
   - Key files and commands
   - Treasury info
   - Quick tests

3. **`docs/archive/README.md`** - Archive index
   - Explains what's archived and why

### 📦 Archived Old Documentation

Moved to `docs/archive/`:
- `NEOD_403_FIX.md` - 403 error fix (issue resolved)
- `NEOD_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` - Debugging guide (superseded)
- `NEOD_PRODUCTION_STATUS.md` - Old status (superseded)
- `NEOD_LAMPORTS_FIX.md` - Failed fix attempt (issue still open)

**Why archived:** Information was redundant, outdated, or consolidated into the new summary.

## Where to Look for NEOD Information

### 🎯 Starting Point
**`NEOD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Start here for quick overview

### 📚 Deep Dive
**`NEOD_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`** - Read this for complete context

### 🔍 Historical Context
**`docs/archive/`** - Old documentation for reference

---

## Key Takeaways

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend: Fully functional
- ✅ Treasury: Funded with 144M NEOD
- ✅ API: Working, no 403 errors
- ❌ Frontend: Transaction creation broken
- 🔴 Blocker: `Blob.encode[lamports]` error

### Recommended Next Step
**Server-side transaction construction** - Build transactions on backend, send to frontend for signing only. This avoids all browser web3.js encoding issues.

### Files to Focus On
- `app/neod.py` - Backend (working)
- `app/static/js/neod.js` - Frontend (needs fix)
- `app/api.py` - API endpoints (may need new endpoint for transaction building)

2. **Quick reference** - Fast lookup without reading everything
3. **Historical record** - Old docs preserved in archive
4. **Clear next steps** - Recommended solution documented
5. **Less confusion** - No conflicting or outdated information
