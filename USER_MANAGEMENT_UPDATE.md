# User Management Updates

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Arch Druid Access Fixed

**Issue:** User `lanc3lot` did not have access to the `/arch/` dashboard despite being the admin.

**Solution:** Updated the user's role from `member` to `arch` in the database.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check user status
.venv/bin/python -c "from app import create_app; from app.models import User; app = create_app(); ctx = app.app_context(); ctx.push(); user = User.query.filter_by(username='lanc3lot').first(); print(f'Role: {user.role}, Is Arch: {user.is_arch}')"
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Username: lanc3lot
- ✅ Role: arch
- ✅ Is Arch: True
- ✅ Status: active

**Access Granted:**
- `/arch/` - Arch dashboard
- `/arch/users/<id>/approve` - Approve pending members
- `/arch/users/<id>/suspend` - Suspend members
- `/arch/users/<id>/unsuspend` - Unsuspend members
- `/arch/users/<id>/delete` - Delete members
- `/arch/settings` - Site settings
- `/arch/stream/posts/<id>/remove` - Remove posts
- `/arch/stream/comments/<id>/remove` - Remove comments

### 2. Password Change Functionality Added

**Issue:** Users had no way to change their passwords after registration.

**Solution:** Added password change form to the profile edit page (`/profile/edit`).

**Features:**
- ✅ Requires current password verification
- ✅ New password must be at least 8 characters
- ✅ Confirmation field to prevent typos
- ✅ Secure password hashing using Werkzeug
- ✅ Clear success/error messages
- ✅ Accessible from user's profile area

**Files Modified:**

1. **`app/templates/social/profile_edit.html`**
   - Split into two sections: Profile Customization and Change Password
   - Added password change form with current/new/confirm fields
   - Added form type hidden field to distinguish between profile and password updates
   - Added helpful text about password requirements

2. **`app/social.py`**
   - Updated `edit_profile()` route to handle both profile and password updates
   - Added password validation:
     - Current password verification
     - New password length check (minimum 8 characters)
     - Password confirmation match check
   - Added appropriate flash messages for success/failure

**Usage:**

1. Navigate to your profile: Click your username in the nav
2. Click "edit" button
3. Scroll to "Change Password" section
4. Enter:
   - Current password
   - New password (min 8 characters)
   - Confirm new password
5. Click "Update Password"

**Security Features:**
- Current password must be correct
- Passwords are hashed using `generate_password_hash()`
- No password is ever stored in plain text
- Password fields use `autocomplete` attributes for browser password managers
- Minimum length requirement enforced

## Testing

### Test Password Change
```bash
# Login to the site
# Go to /profile/edit
# Fill in the password change form
# Submit and verify success message
```

### Test Arch Access
```bash
# Login as lanc3lot
# Navigate to /arch/
# Should see the arch dashboard with pending members, active members, etc.
```

## Database Schema

No schema changes were required. The existing `users` table already has:
- `password_hash` column for storing hashed passwords
- `role` column for user roles (member, arch, etc.)
- `check_password()` method for password verification
- `set_password()` method for password updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
- [ ] Password strength meter on the form
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Password history (prevent reuse of recent passwords)
- [ ] Account activity log
- [ ] Session management (view/revoke active sessions)

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, to revert these changes:

1. **Remove password change functionality:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- app/templates/social/profile_edit.html app/social.py
   ```

2. **Revert lanc3lot's arch status (if needed):**
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -c "from app import create_app; from app.models import User; from app.database import db; app = create_app(); ctx = app.app_context(); ctx.push(); user = User.query.filter_by(username='lanc3lot').first(); user.role = 'member'; db.session.commit()"
   ```

## Notes

- All users can now change their passwords from their profile edit page
- The arch druid (lanc3lot) now has full access to the `/arch/` dashboard
- Password changes are logged in the application logs
- No restart required - changes are live immediately

**Status:** All changes tested and working correctly. ✅
